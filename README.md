The API request cap presented the biggest difficulty for me when testing this assignment. I was able to utilize Travis CI to carry on testing after reaching the restriction locally, but that too soon reached the limit.
Overall, producing simpler, more testable code when you approach development with the attitude of a tester is really advantageous, and I will bear that in mind going forward.
